This project is an SPA bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and built under the principles of atomic web design using reusable MaterialUI components.

The app consists of three pages, (only two of them are mandatory):
- Login page, (Mandatory).
- Dashboard, (Mandatory).
- Error, not found, page, (Not Mandatory).

Authentication is basic, using local storage, and input validation for login.
Username and password should:
- Contain at least 6 characters.
- Not contain special characters and / or spaces.
- Should not be empty.

The routing system redirect to login as a root route, and let us know if a route exists in the app or not, (it redirects to Error Not Found Page). Navigation is based in this routing system.

Inside dashboard an API call is made, using a secret key registered as an env file, you should add your own variable for made this call.
If you have yours, API call will be made normally, and data will render, if you don't set it, Error Boundary will display.

Finally, you can logout by clicking in Logout button inside the Dasboard.
